A simple personality test application, that takes 3-5 different questions, maps them into a score and produces a personality trait of either Introvert or Extrovert.

You can find examples of questions here: https://www.psychologies.co.uk/self/are-you-an-introvert-or-an-extrovert.html

An example could be:

Landing screen
Start personality test
Dynamic screen, that reads question and answers from a the backend (Just mock the backend)
Finish screen, where you can see your personality trait.
