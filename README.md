Show us what you can do
The goal is for us to get a deeper understanding of how you structure your code. Once you are done with the assignment, you will speak to one of our experts to elaborate on your thinking. We leave it up to you to spend the time you need to finish the project.

The following things will be assessed by the technical screener:

Fulfillment of the requirements
Code cleanliness
Project structure
Commit history
Tests and Testability
The scores and your test project will be part of your profile / candidate presentation to the customers. It highly increases your chances of landing a role and decreases the likelihood of a customer asking for yet another test project.

Your assignment
Build a simple personality test application, that takes 3-5 different questions, maps them into a score and produces a personality trait of either Introvert or Extrovert.



You can find examples of questions here: https://www.psychologies.co.uk/self/are-you-an-introvert-or-an-extrovert.html



An example could be:

Landing screen
Start personality test
Dynamic screen, that reads question and answers from a the backend (Just mock the backend)
Finish screen, where you can see your personality trait.


It is a plus if you write some unit-tests.
